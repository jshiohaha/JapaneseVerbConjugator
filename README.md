# Japanese Verb Conjugator

Japanese Verb Conjugator is a Python library for conjugating Japanese verbs.
This fork is used to fix some Issues in the usage of the base package.
Changes will be recorded in CHANGELOG.md

### What forms will Japanese Verb Conjugator conjugate?

Japanese Verb Conjugator conjugates the following verb forms:

- plain form
- polite form
- ~te form
- conditional form
- volitional form
- potential form
- imperative form
- provisional form
- causative form
- passive form

Japanese Verb Conjugator conjugates verbs based on `verb class`, `tense`, `formality`, and `polarity` parameters. Depending on the conjugation and [verb class](https://wtawa.people.amherst.edu/jvrules/index.php?form=groups), the parameters for conjugation methods may vary.

**Example**

`generate_plain_form` requires `verb class`, `tense`, and `formality` parameters.

`generate_volitional_form` requires `verb class`, `tense`, and `polarity` parameters.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install `japanese-verb-conjugator`. If you want to install `japanese-verb-conjugator` and its dependencies in a virtual environment, first create and activiate a virtual environment. If you want to change the virtual environment name to someting other than `venv`, replace the second `venv` with your desired name. Use that same name to replace `venv` in the second command.

```python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

If you run into trouble, see the [Python Virtual Environment tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

### Method 1: Pypi

After installing and activating the virtual environment, run the following commands to install `japanese-verb-conjugator` and its dependencies.

```bash
pip install japanese-verb-conjugator
```

#### Note

Pip may display an error during installation that includes the following message.

```
No matching distribution found for romkan (from JapaneseVerbConjugator)
```

In this case, run the command `pip install romkan` and then run `pip install japanese-verb-conjugator` again.

You should be good to go! See the **Usage** section on how to get started using the library.

### Method 2: Clone this repository

Go to the directory you want to clone this repository and run the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bel-Shazzar/JapaneseVerbConjugator.git
```

To install the Library use the following command

```bash
pip install .
```

To run the library you should install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should be good to go! See the **Usage** section on how to get started using the library.

## Usage

Here is an example of how to import the library and use it.

```python
from japverbconj.constants.enumerated_types import Formality, Polarity, Tense, VerbClass
from japverbconj.verb_form_gen import JapaneseVerbFormGenerator as jvfg

jvfg.generate_plain_form("飲む", VerbClass.GODAN, Tense.NONPAST, Polarity.POSITIVE) # returns '飲む'
jvfg.generate_plain_form("飲む", VerbClass.GODAN, Tense.NONPAST, Polarity.NEGATIVE) # returns '飲まない'
```

The library will try to help validate the correctness of the verb by checking for invalid verb lengths, non-Japanese characters, and invalid verb endings. **Limitation**: this library cannot identify Chinese words with valid Japanese particle endings or nonexistent Japanese verbs.

## Tests

The coverage package is used to run the unittests. The configuration is defined in `.coveragerc`
To run the tests, first install the testing requirements

```bash
pip install -r test/requirements.txt
```

### Run tests

You can run the tests like this

```bash
coverage run -m unittest
```

#### View coverage report

After running the tests with coverage you can show the coverage report like this

```bash
coverage report
```

Alternativly you can generate an html representation like this

```bash
coverage html
```

You can open the html in a browser like this

```bash
open htmlcov/index.html
```
